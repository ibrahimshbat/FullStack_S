# Let's put it all together. Write code for the function process_madlib, which takes in
# a string "madlib" and returns the string "processed", where each instance of
# "NOUN" is replaced with a random noun and each instance of "VERB" is
# replaced with a random verb. You're free to change what the random functions
# return as verbs or nouns for your own fun, but for submissions keep the code the way it is!
